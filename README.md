#Physio Exercises App 

This Django web application allows physiotherapists to generate email templates containing exercise prescriptions for their patients.

Exercises can be added or modified in the Django admin area. 

Shell scripts to start and stop the server locally are included, as this app has not been deployed.
Sheell scripts can be used with Mac Automator applicationn to run a local version of the app.
